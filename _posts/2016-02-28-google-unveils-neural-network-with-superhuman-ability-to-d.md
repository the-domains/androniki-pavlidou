description: "Guessing the location of a randomly chosen Street View image is hard, even for well-traveled humans. But Google's latest artificial-intelligence machine manages it with relative ease. Here's a tricky task. Pick a photograph from the Web at random. Now try to work out where it was taken using only the image itself."
