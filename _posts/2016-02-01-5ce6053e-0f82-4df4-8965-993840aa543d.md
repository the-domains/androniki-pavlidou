More competition on \#VR as it looks like \#Apple will also enter the game!

The last article I remember made me jealous for nor living in USA was a 'big' amusement park all build on VR! You could play and move around a game themed park, feeling the wind, rain, fire and all kinds of interactions from your environment. Super! But that would be available at least for now only in US. 

What if we could all have the opportunity to enjoy VR in our homes, at work,  in a amusement place? It looks like Oculus rift is still quite expensive, though the company announced that its product price is so low(!) that it berely covers its costs!!!! I wouldn't expect that for a product that costs 599$ (or in Europe 699Euros)!

And while having a nice dream wearing an Oculus Rift one day, Apple seems to be silently preparing its own version of VR glasses. Apple's already acquired [Faceshift][0] (motion capture), [Metaio][1] (augmented reality), and [PrimeSense][2] (3D sensing). And in 2013, it patented an Oculus looking like headset.

But wait, didn't Microsoft present Microsoft Hololens few months ago? Yes indeed. But Hololens is half VR and half Augmented reality, merging real with virtual world. (https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us)

I still have Robert's Scoble comments in FB about the best VR headsets he tried so far....IonVR. "This interview made my entire week. Why? Because this is the best of the mobile VR headsets I've seen (and I've seen most of them at this point).[http://ionvr.com/][3]has the best optics and special technology that keeps you from getting sick when watching VR. Here IonVR's Founder and President,[Dan Thurber][4]along with[Brooke Linville][5], the company's CEO, shows us the headset and explains why his headset is so much better.".

One of my favorites and waiting to see startups on AR is Magic Leap. I loved their demo video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSoSofLenSs) and its applications on so many sectors...health, education, games, work, etc.

So, all these made me think again that maybe its not just that...Its a totally new entertainment experience. Oculus annouced its Oculus StoryStudio...movies made by oculus team, that you could 'live' wearing an Oculus rift.
